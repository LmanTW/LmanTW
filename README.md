# About Me

Hello there, I'm a homeschooling student from [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan). I started my programming journey with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LmanTW/) and then transitioned to "real coding" with [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Now, I'm looking forward to learning more about programming and make more cool projects!
